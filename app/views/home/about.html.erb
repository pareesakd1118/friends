        The Friends App was born out of the simple idea that keeping track of all the important people in your life shouldn't be so difficult. Our creator found it challenging to manage contact details, like email, phone number and twitter handles across multiple platforms and apps. Instead of having this information scattered all over the place, why not have it consolidated in one convenient space?
      </p>
      
      <p class="mb-4">
        That's how the Friends App came to lifeâ€”a platform where you can easily manage and organize all the information about your favorite people. The Friends App is here to help you keep everything together, so you never miss a beat with the people that matter most.
