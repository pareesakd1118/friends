<p align='center'>ðŸ‘†<b>Click the heading to visit the deploy link</b>ðŸ‘†</p> <p align="center">The Friends App is a social network for keeping track of your favorite people all in one place. The idea behind this project came from the challenge of managing contact details about friends across various platforms. Instead of having everything scattered between social media sites, messaging apps, and notes, the Friends App consolidates all the information about the people you care about, making it easier to keep in touch and build stronger relationships.</p>
